1) Define 4 simple pytest test cases
2) Run Pytest test cases in a distributed environment, using selenium-server jar, i.e we will create
a grid using selenium-server jar, and run the tests there.
3) Replicate the grid using docker-containers
4) Containerize the client system, which used to keep the source & test code, and will fire the test execution request to hub.
5) Create a complete disposable environment, which include the client system.
6) Create the complete environment in AWS.
7) Automation all these tasks using Jenkins
